COLLECTIONS

Your classes must compile meet the following requirements:

    (25 points) Write a class to represent your data.
        The class can be simplified a version of the data. You do not need to include all variables in the dataset.
        The class should have:
            instance data variables
            constructor
            getters/setters
            toString
            equals method
            compareTo method (the class should implement Comparable<MyClass>)
    (25 points) In a separate class, read in your data file and create objects of your class. 
    (20 points) Create at least one list and at least one map of your data. 
    (30 points) Answer at least two interesting queries/questions about your data.
        Examples from the data set used in the lecture video: What is the business owner with the most businesses? How many out-of-state businesses are on the list?
        The queries can use either the list or the map.
            Consider how you can build a map to efficiently answer your query!
        For full credit, avoid using Java 8 streams to answer your queries. (We'll cover this in the future!)
        Put comments in the file to list the query/question you are answering.
